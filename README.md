This repo holds program prompts and vocabulary that academy students can use for self assessment. Modules roughly match one week in the full time course, or two weeks in the evening course.

You should be: 
- able to do the exercises with some effort at the end of the module where they're taught.
- able to do the exercises confidently at the end of the next module.
- familiar with the words in the vocabulary. You don't have to know exact definitions, but you should be able to talk about them some.
