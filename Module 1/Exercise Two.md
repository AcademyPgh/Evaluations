Write a program that can do the following:

Ask the user for the length and the width of a garden bed. Then ask them for how many board heights the bed will be. Then, using the following formula, give the user the following information.

* Perimeter `length * 2 + width * 2`
* Area `length * width`

* Total board feet needed `perimeter * board height`
* Total bags of dirt needed `area * board height / 2`

```
