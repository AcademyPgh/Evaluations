Write a program that can do the following:

Write the fizz buzz application, but let the user choose the starting and ending number to count to.

Reminder: The rules of fizzbuzz are as follows.
* Write out all numbers
* If the number is divisible by 3, then write "fizz" instead of the number
* If the number is divisible by 5, then write "buzz" instead of the number
* If the number is divisible by both, then write "fizzbuzz" instead of the number

```
