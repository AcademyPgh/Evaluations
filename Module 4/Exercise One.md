## TDD - red, green, refactor

1. Red: Write a single test for a Morse code converter. Run it, and make sure it fails.
1. Green: Now write some cool code that makes your test pass. Run it, and make sure it passes.
1. Refactor: Now you can change your code to make it better. Don't add new functionality, and make sure your tests are still green at the end.
