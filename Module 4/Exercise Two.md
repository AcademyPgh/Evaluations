## A good list of tests
In this exercise, you aren't going to write any code. Make a list of cases you would want to test if you were writing a Roman numeral converter.

Make sure your list thoroughly covers the functionality you intend to code. Include happy path and non-happy-path cases.

If you wrote code that passed these tests, would you be confident 
1. that it worked and 
1. that someone else just reading the tests would know what it does and how to use it?
