## Write some thoroughly tested code
Make your tests from [exercise 2](Exercise%20Two.md) real - write a test file and a Roman numeral converter that passes your test cases.

Give it to another human being and see if
1. They can break it in a way you haven't documented through tests
2. They understand how to use it without looking at the code, just the tests.
